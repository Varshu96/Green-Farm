						<b>-</b>Soil carbon (closely related to soil organic matter) is beneficial for soil health for many reasons,including improved water infiltration, improved water retention, reduced erosion, improved tilth,and improved biological activity. Increasing the amount of carbon stored in soils has multipleagricultural and environmental benefits, including improved yields, increased resistance to drought and flooding, improved water quality, and reduced carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere. This Information Sheet focuses on how farms can reduce CO2 emissions using soil health best management practices (BMPs). However, it should be noted that it takes decades tobuild up (sequester) soil carbon but only months or a few years to lose the sequestered carbon due to tillage and other soil disturbing practices.. <br><br>

						<b>-</b> Soils must be thoroughly mixed before they are steamed given that steam does not penetrate large lumps of soil to bring the temperature to the necessary level. The large pores in loose root substrates facilitate the movement of steam and thereby cut down the length of time required to pasteurize the soil as well as more effective in controlling soil-borne diseases, insects, nematodes, and weeds..

						<b>-</b>Soil pasteurization kills pathogenic organisms and weed seeds using aerated steam. It is customary to apply steam for 30 minutes beyond the time when the coldest spot in the batch of root substrate being pasteurized reaches 140 degrees F (60°C), although many growers pasteurize at a temperature of 160 degrees F (71°C). Most plant pathogens are killed by exposure to aerated steam at 140 degrees F (60°C) for a minimum of 30 minutes while higher temperatures are required to kill weed seeds. Some growers, however, over-steam the soil by increasing the temperature to 212 degrees F (100°C) and hold it at this level for several hours. Over-steaming can cause a build of harmful substances in the soil—manganese toxicity and ammonium toxicity. Steam is provided by a portable steam generator or main steam line in the greenhouse. Soilless root media do not usually requiresteaming because the ingredients do not harbor pathogens and other harmfulorganisms. However, if soil-mixing equipment is exposed to dust and debris, or soilless media ingredients become contaminated ,it is a good idea to pasteurize even soilless root media.. <br><br>

						<b>-</b> There are two common methods of steam treatment: freeflowing and aerated. When steam leaves the boiler it is under slight pressure (5 to 15 psi). As soon as it is released into the growing mix it drops to atmospheric pressure giving up its heat. At this point it is considered freeflowing. As the temperature drops, it creates a heat zone that advances as the surrounding soil is heated.. <br><br>

						<b>-</b> Soil fumigation is a chemical control strategy used independently or in conjunction with cultural and physical control methods to reduce populations of soil organisms. Soil fumigants can effectively control soil-borne organisms, such as nematodes, fungi, bacteria, insects, weed seeds, and weeds. Different fumigants have varying effects on the control of these pests. Some are pest-specific, while others are broad spectrum biocides and kill most soil organisms. Because of treatment costs, applicators use soil fumigants primarily on high value crops, such as vegetables, fruits, and ornamentals. Very careful attention must be paid to the details of how the fumigation is done in order to guarantee excellent control of the targeted organisms and complete safety for workers and other persons close to the treated area, while also limiting the impact the product could have on our environment.. <br><br>
						<b>Types of Soil Fumigants:</b></br></br>
						<b>-</b> Soil fumigation uses pesticide formulations that volatilize from a liquid or solid into a gas state. Soil fumigants are applied to the soil as liquefied gases, volatile liquids, or granules. Due to the high volatility of these compounds, the fumigant must be incorporated into the soil during or immediately following application. At or shortly after application, these chemicals volatilize, allowing toxic molecules to move through the air pores in the soil. Soil pests are killed when they come in contact with a toxic concentration for a long enough exposure period. For all fumigants, enough concentration and contact time with target pests are required to obtain good results <br><br>

						<b>-</b> Solarization is a form of soil pasteurization whereby solar energy is trapped beneath plastic sheets spread on the soil surface. It is a cheap and effective means in controlling many important soilborne fungal and bacterial plant pathogens, including those that cause Verticillium wilt, Fusarium wilt, Phytophthora root rot, Southern blight, damping off, crown gall disease, tomato canker, potato scab, and many others. A few heat-tolerant fungi and bacteria are more difficult to control with solarization. Soil solarization can be used to control many species of nematodes. Soil solarization controls many of the annual and perennial weeds. A smooth bed, with clods and litter raked away, is best because the plastic will lie snugly against the soil and have fewer air pockets. Air pockets between the plastic and the soil can greatly reduce soil heating and promote “sailing” of the plastic in the wind.. <br><br>
						
						<b>-</b> Soil solarization is a method of soil-disinfestation based on its solar heating by mulching a soil with a transparent polyethylene during the hot season, thereby controlling soilborne pests. Pathogen and disease control are attributed to microbial, chemical, and physical processes in addition to the thermal killing..<br><br>
